There are a few steps to follow to run a Python script automatically on startup and in the background in Ubuntu:

1. Create a Python script: First, create a Python script that you want to run automatically on startup. Save the script in a location that is accessible to you.

2. Make the script executable: Next, make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    chmod +x /path/to/your/script.py
    ```
3. Open the startup applications: Press the "Windows" key on your keyboard and search for "Startup Applications" and open it.

4. Add a new startup program: Click the "Add" button to add a new startup program.

5. Fill in the details: In the "Command" field, enter the command to run your Python script, such as:
    ```
    /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py &
    ```
    The "&" at the end of the command will run the script in the background. In the "Name" and "Comment" fields, enter a name and description for your startup program.
6. Save the changes: Click "Add" to save your new startup program.

7. Restart your computer: Restart your computer to see if your Python script runs automatically on startup.

That's it! Your Python script should now run automatically on startup and in the background in Ubuntu.
